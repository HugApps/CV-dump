# Team Poopnado

## Main Project


#### Get Started with Vagrant

Run `vagrant up`.

The site will run over HTTP (port 8080).

To restart the site processes, do `vagrant ssh` and then `sudo systemctl restart sws`.

NOTE: SCSS autorecompilation does not work because fsevents doesn't seem to work over shared folders.
Restart with the above command to see style changes.

NOTE: Please delete `node_modules` to avoid issues. This is not likely to work with Windows.

#### Get Started in Production

Make sure there is an attr.json file with the following:
```
{
  "public_attr": "<fully qualified domain name without protocol>",
  "certbot_email": "<email for certbot registration>",
  "run_list": "recipe[baseconfig]
}
```

Run the following command:
```
cd service-worker-site/chef && sudo chef-client -z -j <absolute path to directory>/attr.json
```

The current node will then be provisioned with the necessary certificates and resources.

PLEASE NOTE: The server must be reachable over the internet at the `public_attr` for certificate provisioning to work.

The site will run over HTTPS (port 443).

#Using the `Blocks` tab:

The `Block` section of the website can be a little confusing when starting off, however it is quite simple once you know what you are doing.

To create a new `Block` you first need to enter a name into the `Name of new block` input.

Once you have done this you can either add a new `Header` or `Skill` `Block` by clicking on the appropriate `+` button.

This button will then add a new `Block` with the name you entered to that section.

To edit a `Block`, all you need to do is click on it and start typing in either the rich editor on the top or the text area on the bottom.

The rich text editor allows you to simply start typing and using the wonderful UI to style your text.

If you wish for more control, all you need to do is directly edit the Markdown in the text area.

Once you are done editing make sure you press the `Save` button before clicking away or your edits will not be saved.
